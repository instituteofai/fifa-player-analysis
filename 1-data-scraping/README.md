# Data Scraping

Our first task is to acquire the data that we need. If there is data that has been collected by someone else and is readily available, or if there is an API available to get this data, then we might consider using what is available. We might also think about tweaking the data into the format we need if it isn't already.

Unfortunately, this isn't the case for the data that we need.

Fortunately, this will help us learn one more importanst skill: data scraping.

Data scraping (more specifically, web scraping) is all about programatically extracting data available from online sources, transforming it into a format that we need, and storing it at our end.

We will scrap stats of players in FIFA 20 from https://sofifa.com. The code and explanation are available in [this](./web-scraping.ipynb) notebook.
